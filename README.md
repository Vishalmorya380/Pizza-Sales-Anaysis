# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard


⚡ Note: This is my initial version of the Pizza Sales Analysis project, created entirely in Microsoft Power BI , powered by sales data from an *Excel dataset*.  

👉 For the enhanced end-to-end project with SQL + Power BI analysis, check here:
Pizza-Sales-Anaysis-Microsof-SQL-PowerBI (SQL + Power BI Project)

The dashboard provides deep insights into pizza sales performance, customer preferences, and category/size trends — all with dynamic slicers and a clean, themed layout.
